/*!
Asciiquarium assets: a small curated set of ASCII fish plus a helper to auto-measure width and height for any multi-line ASCII art.

Notes:
- Width is the maximum visible character count across all lines (Unicode scalar count).
- Height is the total number of lines returned by `.lines()`.
- Leading/trailing blank lines in raw strings will count toward height.
- Rendering code will clip as needed; assets need not avoid whitespace.

These assets are intentionally simple; expand as desired with additional creatures.

Example:
```text
